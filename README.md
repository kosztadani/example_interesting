# Java examples I found to be interesting

## Description

I intend to show some Java examples I found to be interesting in this repo.

## Running the examples

It's best to run these examples from your favorite IDE to see the code being executed.

You could also use Gradle to build and then execute directly with `java`.
In this case, it is recommended to `cat` the corresponding source code.

```bash
./gradlew build
```

Messing around with Unicode escape sequences...

```bash
cat src/main/java/dev/kosztadani/examples/intersting/unicode/EvilComment.java
java -cp build/classes/java/main dev.kosztadani.examples.intersting.unicode.EvilComment
```

#### HiddenComment

```bash
cat src/main/java/dev/kosztadani/examples/intersting/unicode/HiddenComment.java
java -cp build/classes/java/main dev.kosztadani.examples.intersting.unicode.HiddenComment
```

#### SeeminglyInvalid

```bash
cat src/main/java/dev/kosztadani/examples/intersting/unicode/SeeminglyInvalid.java
java -cp build/classes/java/main dev.kosztadani.examples.intersting.unicode.SeeminglyInvalid
```
